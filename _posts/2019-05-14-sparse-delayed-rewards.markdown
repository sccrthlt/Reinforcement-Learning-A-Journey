- would be cool to have expandable tabs so when clicked on branch it expanded to sub branches and individual solutions
- delayed and sparse are two separate problems: delayed is fundamental to reinforcement learning. Sparse is fundamental to machine learning in general

# Abstract
This is an abstract on the items....

# Intro
One of the outstanding research questions within RL is how to learn from reward signals that may be **sparse**, **delayed**, or both.
- Define sparse delayed rewards functionally

- Many real-world problems contain [reward functions]() that .
- The goal is to extract as much predictive power as possible from the reward signal.

- An example... using extremes to get the point across.

- Define sparse rewards equations
- Define delayed Rewards equations
- visual example

- example of simulations where x axis is length of delay and y is the median learning across several episodes

# Branches

### Problems
